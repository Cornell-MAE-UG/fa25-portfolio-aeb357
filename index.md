## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Alfonso Barbaran, and I am a first-generation student at Cornell University pursuing a degree in Civil Engineering. Growing up in Newark, New Jersey, I witnessed firsthand how construction can strengthen and transform communities. Those experiences solidified my passion for civil engineering and inspired me to pursue a career focused on building environments that improve people’s lives.

Community has always been important to me. Whether I’m spending time with friends, attending office hours, or contributing to my project team with Engineers Without Borders, I enjoy being engaged and supporting the people around me. I’m an early bird and try to maintain a disciplined lifestyle that helps me stay focused on my academic and personal goals.

Outside of engineering, I’m a huge film enthusiast. I’m drawn to the sets, whether practical or CGI, and the way structures shape the worlds we see on screen. That blend of creativity and design fuels my own dreams. My dream is to become a project manager and one day start my own firm, combining technical expertise with the vision to build spaces that inspire.
