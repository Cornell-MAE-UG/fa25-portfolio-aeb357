## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
I am a civil engineering student at Cornell University with a strong foundation in structural mechanics, engineering computation, and project management. My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience in both technical and community-focused roles. Through my involvement with Engineers Without Borders, I collaborate on sustainable infrastructure projects that emphasize user-centered design and long-term impact. As a mentor with the Cornell EMPower program, I support first-year engineering students in their academic and professional development, fostering leadership and communication skills along the way.

My research experience at the Engineering Summer Math Institute allowed me to explore simulation modeling and policy analysis, highlighting my interest in the intersection of engineering and public infrastructure. I also gained industry experience during my internship at Audible, where I contributed to cross-functional product development and honed skills in agile project management and stakeholder communication.

With technical proficiency in tools like AutoCAD and Excel, and a working knowledge of Agile practices and structural analysis, I bring a well-rounded approach to engineering challenges. I am passionate about designing practical, sustainable solutions and thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply both technical and interpersonal skills to make a meaningful impact.
