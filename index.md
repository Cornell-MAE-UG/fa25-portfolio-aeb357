## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}








 
My name is Alfonso Barbaran, a first-generation student at Cornell University studying Civil Engineering. Growing up in Newark, New Jersey, I saw how thoughtful construction can strengthen communities, and those experiences shaped both my identity and my career goals. I’m driven by discipline, community, and the desire to build environments that uplift the people who live in them.

Beyond academics, I stay grounded by getting involved—whether that’s collaborating with my Engineers Without Borders team, spending time with friends, or showing up early to learn and connect. I’m also a film enthusiast who loves the art of worldbuilding, from practical sets to CGI landscapes. That blend of creativity and engineering fuels my long-term goal of becoming a project manager and eventually starting my own firm.
