This portfolio assignment focuses on analyzing a real-world device or system covered in the course. The report explains in detail how the selected device or system operates, supported by photos, schematics, and a qualitative discussion of its function. A system diagram is included to illustrate the operational mode—either as a control mass or control volume—showing all relevant heat transfer, work interactions, and mass flows. The analysis applies the appropriate mass, energy, and entropy balance equations to capture the fundamental physics governing the system’s behavior. Finally, the report evaluates how the device’s performance would change under a modified design or altered operating conditions, demonstrating an understanding of both current functionality and potential improvements.
