For this project, I designed a rigid-bar mechanism within a 150 cm × 50 cm space using three pin supports (two on the ground) and a linear actuator rated at 3 kN. The goal was to lift the maximum weight to the highest height while keeping all components rigid.
I modeled the system using static equilibrium and took moments about one ground pin to relate the actuator force (Fa) and the lifted weight (W). From geometry, W = Fa * sin(theta), showing that the lift depends on the actuator’s vertical component. To maximize W, I positioned the actuator so it acts nearly vertically at the top height (50 cm).
Under ideal conditions, the design can lift about 3000 N (approximately 306 kg) when the actuator is vertical. This design demonstrates how optimizing geometry and actuator orientation can significantly increase lifting performance within limited space.
