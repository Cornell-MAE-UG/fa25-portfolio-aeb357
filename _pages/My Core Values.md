## My Core Values

As a first-generation Civil Engineering student at Cornell University, my core values are shaped by my experiences growing up in Newark, New Jersey and by the goals I’ve set for my future. Community Impact is central to who I am. From an early age, I saw how construction can reshape neighborhoods, provide stability, and create opportunities. This taught me to view engineering as more than technical work, but as well as a responsibility to build structures that support and uplift the people who rely on them.

Discipline is equally as important. I’m an early riser, and maintaining structure in my daily life helps me stay grounded, focused, and prepared. Whether it’s showing up to office hours or dedicating time to my project team with Engineers Without Borders, I believe discipline creates consistency, and consistency leads to growth.

My passion for film reflects another core value: Curiosity and Creativity. I’m fascinated by the worlds built on-screen, from practical sets to complex CGI environments. This curiosity inspires my engineering work, reminding me that creativity and technical skill can and should coexist in meaningful ways.

I also value Leadership Through Service. I enjoy being part of collaborative environments, supporting those around me, and contributing positively to any team I join and is also the reason why I have participated as a peer mentor throughout my time. I see myself as a leader, trying to bring people togther and share with them my experiences and give advice.
